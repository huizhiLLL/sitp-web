# What's This?

## Overview

The FC-Catalyst Prediction Tool is a machine learning-powered web application designed to predict the performance of fuel cell catalysts based on their composition and operating conditions. This tool helps researchers and engineers quickly evaluate catalyst configurations without the need for extensive laboratory testing.

## Purpose

Fuel cell catalyst development is a time-consuming and resource-intensive process. Traditional approaches require:

- Extensive laboratory synthesis and testing
- Multiple iterations to optimize performance
- Significant material and time investments

Our prediction tool accelerates this process by leveraging machine learning models trained on historical catalyst performance data. By inputting key parameters, you can receive instant predictions about catalyst efficiency and performance characteristics.

## ML-Based Approach

The tool uses a machine learning model trained on a comprehensive dataset of fuel cell catalyst experiments. The model learns patterns and relationships between:

- **Catalyst composition** (e.g., Pt/C, PtRu/C, PtCo/C)
- **Loading amounts** (catalyst density on the electrode)
- **Operating conditions** (temperature, pressure, humidity)
- **Performance outcomes** (efficiency, durability, power output)

By analyzing these relationships, the model can predict how a catalyst will perform under specific conditions, providing valuable insights for catalyst design and optimization.

## Key Features

### Instant Predictions
Get immediate feedback on catalyst performance without waiting for laboratory results.

### Parameter Exploration
Easily test different combinations of catalyst compositions and operating conditions to find optimal configurations.

### Data-Driven Insights
Predictions are based on real experimental data, providing scientifically grounded estimates.

### Accessible Interface
Simple web-based interface requires no specialized software or technical setup.

## Use Cases

- **Research Planning**: Identify promising catalyst candidates before committing to synthesis
- **Parameter Optimization**: Find optimal operating conditions for specific catalyst compositions
- **Comparative Analysis**: Quickly compare multiple catalyst configurations
- **Educational Tool**: Learn about the relationships between catalyst properties and performance

## Limitations

While the prediction tool provides valuable insights, it's important to understand its limitations:

- Predictions are estimates based on training data and may not capture all real-world complexities
- The model's accuracy depends on the similarity between your inputs and the training dataset
- Experimental validation is still recommended for critical applications
- The tool currently uses a mock prediction function for demonstration purposes
